Tree Oyster Mushrooms
=====================

Tree Oyster Mushroom - *Pluerotus Ostreatus*

Growing Conditions
------------------
- Cool temperatures (10-15 C)
- High humidity (~50% relative humidity)
- Needs some light, but no direct sunlight. Light from a window is sufficient.

Growing Instructions
--------------------
1. *First*, the cotton at the top of the package can be removed. Don't worry if it's stuck.
2. *To activate the Block*, place the block in your growing environment for a few days.
A block is activated if you can see *pins* growing.
3. *Once pins have formed*, make several slits in the bottom of the bag.
Open the top, and pour cold water into the top of the bag.
The water won't flow through that quickly, but that's okay.
Leave in the sink to drain for half an hour.
Turn the block over once to drain water off the top.
Close the bag as it was originally, and let grow.
4. *Once buttons have formed*, make 5 slits in the bag near the top of the block.
Mushsrooms will grow through these.
Optionally, you can erect a "tent" over the block using a poly bag to maintain humidity.
5. *Every few days*, drench the block as before.
Make sure it never remains continuously wet as mushrooms grow, or the block can rot.
6. *When the caps begin to flatten*, you can harvest.
Harvest by twisting a cluster of mushrooms at their base.
New mushrooms will sprout from these bases.
7. *After a large harvest*, the block will need more water.
Rest it at warmer temperatures (18-25C) for 2-4 weeks.
8. *Once the block is rested*, replenish its moisture by immersing it in *cold* water for a few hours.
9. *After a few hours*, drain the block well and return it to a loose-fitting poly bag.
10. *After a week*, your mushrooms should grow back.
11. *After 3 or 4 harvests*, your block will be done.

Troubleshooting
---------------
- *Long, tubular shrooms with small caps?* Bad ventilation, too much CO2.
- *Small caps?* Could be low light.
- *Shrooms turning yellow/orange, or dying early?* Your shrooms are too wet.
- *Shrooms cracking or scaling?* Too dry!
- *Block not pinning?* Top of block is too dry.

Vocabulary
----------
- *pins*: Small mushroom sprouts.
- *buttons*: Slightly bigger than pins, 1/4 to 1.5 inches in diameter.
- *substrate*: The block itself, made of sawdust, grain, wheat bran, and limestone.
- *mycelium*: The "root" fungus of a mushroom family.
